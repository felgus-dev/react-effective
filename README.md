# React Effective

## ALPHA VERSION, DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION

A small, reliable and easy to use react utilities to help you improve the reactivity and runtime safety in your applications.

React uses a coarse-grain reactivity model, and there are some gaps in the conceptual system, which we try to fill with these utils. Using them, you avoid common wronge usages of `useEffect` and improve
your code redability and performance.

And it has some utils to improve runtime data safety, validating the data with schemas and avoid wrong and unsecure inputs to get inside the React application.
